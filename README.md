this project was a counter using react and useState. this project taught me how react updates certain parts of a website without needing to refresh the entire website. as simple as this project is, I faced minor issues at first getting used to count and setCount. Once I got comfortable with using setCount to set the count instead of the way I am used to, I found useState very easy to work with.



to run this project, clone the repo, then open terminal and run "npm install" in the root folder. next run "npm start" in terminal and open your web browser and navigate to "https://http://localhost:3000/"
